# Dash-Admin

### Intro
#### Dash-Admin is an extension for [Dash](https://github.com/plotly/dash) to help start new Dash applications.

Dash-Admin takes inspiration from the ```django-admin``` command in the popular Python web framework [Django](https://github.com/django/django).  The goal of dash-admin is to provide a simple, easy-to-use CLI tool for staring projects in Dash.  Getting a working Dash application is as simple as:

```dash-admin startproject myproject```

This will give you a working Dash application, complete with user authentication, user management (both online and through the CLI), and an main page with an interactive Plotly chart.  To start the application, enter:

```python run.py```

and visit [localhost:8050](http://localhost:8050).

You can log in with username admin and password admin.

### Documentation
